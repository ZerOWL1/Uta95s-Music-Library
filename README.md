## Entertainment

- [Product Background] 

	- [PB] Music listening is up. Respondents typically spend 18 hours per week listening to music – up from 17.8 hours in 2018. This equates to about 2.6 hours – or the equivalent of listening to 52 three-minute songs – daily. Most people (54%) identify as ‘loving’ or being ‘fanatical’ about music. Among 16 – 24-year-olds, this rises to 63%, and nowadays, this number rises rapidly. That marketplace motivates us to make a music library website and music player (features). We focus on Japan and China's music industry, those big music industries in the world.
	
- [Business Opportunity] - Why i made a music library website and focus on Japan and China's music industry?.

	- [BO1] First, i know that china and japan are the biggest music industry in the world, they have big fans and their idol, the cd industry it rises rapidly by every single day. Just think about if we ask around 100-meter people, how many of them will sing and share for you a Japanese song?
	- [BO2] Second, i'm merely functioning as an index of content found publicly on the Internet and it's a good point. They found their favorites music with high rates and lossless but didn't found this. That why our website provide high rates and a lossless music library.
